5, Asking and attempting to solve open questions
6, Oral presentations using powerpoint slides and a poster
7, Writing a scientific report
8, Improving scientific communication skills by creating popular science figures and articles 

For each topic, you will be assigned a grade (up to 20 points) based on the following metrics:
