This class is about data analysis and processing for astronomoy at undergraduate entry level. 

Days: MWF
Time: 1:50PM - 2:45PM
Location: Arps Hall 012

We will go over five (maybe more) major topics on the very frontier of astrophysics, inlucidng dark matter, dark energy, exoplanets, gravitational wave, and stellar physics. For each topic, we will adopt the following structure train your wholistic research skills:
1, Understanding the scientific importance
2, Understanding the underlying physics and math
3, Working out a problem as an individual or within a team
4, Reading research papers to understand the gap between different approaches (e.g., yours vs. other reserachers)
5, Asking and attempting to solve open questions
6, Oral presentations using powerpoint slides and a poster
7, Writing a scientific report
8, Improving scientific communication skills by creating popular science figures and articles 

For each topic, you will be assigned a grade (up to 20 points) based on the following metrics:
1, Written report (5 pts)
2, Oral presentation with slides or poster presentation (5 pts)
3, Self-evalution (5 pts)
4, Professor evaluation based on the above 3 categories and classroom participation (5 pts)

Evaluation and rubric:
Your oral presentation and written report will be evaluated by other teams based the following rubric. Your score will be the average of scores from other teams. 
1, 5 pts for the oral presentation.
	A, Is the presentation clear? (1 pt)
	B, Is the presentation engaging? (1 pt)
C, Is the presentation complete, i.e., covering motivation, methods, results, and conclusions (2 pt)
	D, Does the presentation address all the questions from audience? (1 pt)
2, 5 pts for the written report.
A, Is the report complete, i.e., covering motivation, methods, results, and conclusions (2 pt)
B, Does the repot clearly lay out all the assumptions and calculations? (1 pt)
C, Does the report address all questions in the project? (1 pt)
D, Are the results sensible? (1 pt)
