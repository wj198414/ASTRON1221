Religious Accommodations
Our inclusive environment allows for religious expression. Students requesting accommodations
based on faith, religious or a spiritual belief system in regard to examinations, other academic
requirements or absences, are required to provide the instructor with written notice of specific
dates for which the student requests alternative accommodations at the earliest possible date. For

Weather Or Other Short-Term Closing
Should in-person classes be canceled, we will meet virtually via CarmenZoom during our
regularly scheduled time. I will share any updates via CarmenCanvas.

Academic Misconduct
It is the responsibility of the Committee on Academic Misconduct to investigate or establish
procedures for the investigation of all reported cases of student academic misconduct. The term
“academic misconduct” includes all forms of student academic misconduct wherever committed;
illustrated by, but not limited to, cases of plagiarism and dishonest practices in connection with
examinations. Instructors shall report all instances of alleged academic misconduct to the
committee (Faculty Rule 3335-5-487). For additional information, see the Code of Student

Students with Disabilities
The University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible
as possible. In light of the current pandemic, students seeking to
request COVID-related accommodations may do so through the
university's request process, managed by Student Life Disability
Services. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers based on
your disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary
medical conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can
privately discuss options. To establish reasonable accommodations,
I may request that you register with Student Life Disability
Services. After registration, make arrangements with me as soon as
possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be
implemented in a timely fashion. SLDS contact

Mental Health
As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as
strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty
concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may
lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in daily
activities. The Ohio State University offers services to assist you with addressing these and other
concerns you may be experiencing. If you or someone you know are suffering from any of the
aforementioned conditions, you can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental
health services available on campus via the Office of Student Life’s Counseling and Consultation
Service (CCS) by visiting ccs.osu.edu or calling 614-292-5766. CCS is located on the 4th Floor
of the Younkin Success Center and 10th Floor of Lincoln Tower. You can reach an on call
counselor when CCS is closed at 614-292-5766 and 24 hour emergency help is also available
24/7 by dialing 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

Title IX
Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights
offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to
offenses against other protected categories (e.g., race). If you or someone you know has been
sexually harassed or assaulted, you may find the appropriate resources at http://titleix.osu.edu or
by contacting the Ohio State Title IX Coordinator at titleix@osu.edu

Diversity
The Ohio State University affirms the importance and value of diversity in the student body. Our
programs and curricula reflect our multicultural society and global economy and seek to provide
opportunities for students to learn more about persons who are different from them. We are
committed to maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity
of every person; fosters sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect among each member of
our community; and encourages each individual to strive to reach his or her own potential.
Discrimination against any individual based upon protected status, which is defined as age, color,
disability, gender identity or expression, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or
veteran status, is prohibited.
